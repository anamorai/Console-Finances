# Console Finances

I have been tasked with creating a code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset.

To complete this I will calculate:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
